### Whatapp give us our data in text formate.
**we have two option**
1. First we should word on same formate.
2. Second we can change file foramte txt to csv (although in pandas we can also read text file as csv reader by using to_csv() method). 

In DataScience, one of the most important things is normaliztion of our data: "have you ever noticed that if you have any long range file, some of data missing, wrong labelled or much more as normal we observed. In that condition, we have to used noramlization techniques to normalized our data sets.
So, the same procedure I opdopted here using pandas library, (Pandas : used for data maniupuaton or more other option, must be readed it documentation).
